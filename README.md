- 👋 Hi, I’m @james10ka
- 👀 I’m interested in free and opensource software, as well as linux. 
- 🌱 I’m currently studying at University as an IT major with experience in coding, but very limited. 
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on honestly, nothing. I am here because I want to create my own edits of dot files and things on Linux and have them saved where others can use them.
if they wish, but as far as working on things goes, I'm going to stay in my own lane lol. 
- 📫 How to reach me: Directly on github for now.
